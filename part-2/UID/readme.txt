this project contains different pages as described bellow:
page 1 (add_actor.php): A page that lets users to add actor and/or director information.
page 2 (add_movie.php): A page that lets users to add movie information.
page 3 (add_Review.php): A page that lets users to add reviews to movies.
page 4 (add_M_A_R.php): A page that lets users to add "actor to movie" relation(s).
page 5 (add_M_D_R.php): A page that lets users to add "director to movie" relation(s).
Page 6 (show_A.php): a page that shows actor information with search function.
Page 7 (show_M.php): a page that shows movie information with search function.
Page 8 (search.php): search for actors/movies by keyword


we used header.php to add the nav bar to each page on load so we wouldn't need to implement
the navbar in every page.

for setting a better collaboration in future it would be beneficial
to divide parts based on similarity it would help to finish the project faster,
having experience with front-end libraries such as bootstrap would be helpful
to make the UI look more professional and more user friendly.
